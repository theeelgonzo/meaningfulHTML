                <h3>Dressing up a Salad</h3>
                <img

                <p>
                    Summer is nearly here! We love this season because it’s the
                    perfect time to eat all the great organic vegetables from
                    our neighboring farms. One way to enjoy the delicious
                    abundance of fresh fruits and vegetables is in salads.
                    However, at Two Trees we <em>refuse</em> to eat boring,
                    tasteless salads. Therefore, we’re going to share with you
                    the reasons to make your own, and the basics for creating
                    custom salad dressings.
                </p>
                <h4>Make your own salad dressing</h4>
                <p>
                    Sure, the grocery store is full of salad dressings, but
                    <strong
                        >often they’re full of preservatives that impact the
                        taste and nutritional value of the dressing</strong
                    >
                    . Furthermore, they can sit on the shelf for a long time
                    before they’re bought, which can further reduce the
                    nutritional value of the product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To get started designing your own custom dressing, you need
                    as little as two ingredients: an oil and an acid. From there
                    you can get as creative as you like.
                </p>
                <h4>Homemade salad dressing is good for your health</h4>
                <p>
                    Olive oil contains polyphenols which, according to research,
                    can play a role in slowing cardiovascular and
                    neurodegenerative diseases. Olive oil also has antioxidant
                    properties. Research into vinegar shows it might be slightly
                    helpful with controlling the body’s glycemic response.
                    Together there’s no doubt, they’re delicious!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use this basic combination here in our
                    <a
                        href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/212896/caprese-appetizer/"
                        target="_blank"
                        >bite-sized Caprese salad appetizer using mini
                        mozzarella balls and cherry tomatoes</a
                    >. We serve this with our basil infused olive oil and aged
                    balsamic vinegar. It’s amazing!
                </p>
                <h4>Make it to your taste</h4>
                <p>
                    There are four main ingredient types to consider when making
                    a salad dressing: fat, acid, sweetener, and spice. For fat
                    we recommend olive oil because it carries flavor so well and
                    it has so many healthy properties, though you can definitely
                    try different oils or healthy fats like avocado.
                </p>
                <h5>Acids</h5>
                <p>
                    The two most common acids in a salad dressing are vinegars
                    and fruit juices. You’ll want to pick the flavors that you
                    think will bring the most out of your salad components. This
                    might require some delicious experimentation!

                </dl>
                <h5>Sweeteners</h5>
                <p>
                    Sugar is a common sweetener used in store-bought salad
                    dressings. However, we recommend trying a sweet fruit juice
                    like orange or a natural sweetener like agave or honey. In
                    fact, if you want an emulsifier in your dressing, honey is
                    an excellent choice. A nice benefit of making your own
                    dressing is that you can control how much added sugar is
                    going into your food.
                </p>
                <h5>Spice</h5>
                <p>
                    Start with salt. A little can go a long way and bring out
                    the natural sweetness in your fruits and vegetables.
                    Experiment with herbs like rosemary, mint, basil, or
                    tarragon. If you’re wanting some extra zip or an emulsifier,
                    try Dijon mustard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The trick to making a brilliant salad dressing is to explore
                    flavors and flavor combinations you enjoy. Take some time
                    this summer and have fun experimenting with the abundance of
                    healthy foods and flavors!
